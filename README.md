# Task Management System

A collaborative task management application built with vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating software engineering principles and team development practices.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
- 👥 **Multi-User Support**: User management and authentication
- 📊 **Analytics**: Task statistics and progress tracking
- 🧪 **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Jest
- 🔄 **Version Control**: Git workflow with feature branches

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ installed
- Git installed and configured
- Modern web browser

### Installation
\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project demonstrates key software engineering principles:

- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of Model, View, and Controller
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Version Control**: Git workflow with feature branches
